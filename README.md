# GD-Final
Game Design final for class

# H1 Title: Drescape [Might change]

# H1 Description:
Basically the idea I came up with was from a music video from this k-pop group I'm obsessed with. Specifically, their song "Magnetic". What I'm going to adapt into a game is basically the second half og the video, where the idols are running through different liminal, dream-like spaces, seemingly trying to get back to reality, at lease that's what I made it out to be. 
- MV Reference: [Magnetic - ILLIT](https://youtu.be/Vk5-c_v4gMU?t=83)

# H1 Ideas and Design notes:
I'm thinking of creating different areas with no recurring pattern, leading into other different areas. In the video, there were little unicorn things that were showing there where to go. I was thinking of creating either a similar "follow-me" mechanism or create collectables. Though I might not do the collectables, don't feel like it.
Completion Outline:
1. Wander from room to room
2. [TBD] Follow the unicorns(?) guiding you to each exit
3. Follow until you return to reality
